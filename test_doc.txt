Streaming this crazy new game tonight! It's called MienCroft or something. I think it must be a Tomb Raider origin story. My lovely chat mods have built something to entertain, terrorize or imprison me in and will be subjecting me to it starting at 8:30!The left nip tassel beguiles the ghost while the right one beckons them closer. And people think we're not serious Paranormal Investigators!Now he's safe forever! And he went to Valhalla with the blood of that random naked pirate guy on his hooves. Streaming tonight at 8:30! There's two very different games I've been meaning to check out for a while. Which should I play? Shooty Looty or Stardew Soap Opera Colony Builder in Space? Thirsty tweets returned in This Just Internet and some folks have some concerns. Want to reassure people that we won't do it often enough to encourage excess comments, I don't read social media so I ain't seeing it normally & I find it hilarious. It's not for everyone though!

Just pretend the dowsing rods are actually awesome batons and not weirdly functional pieces of bent metal.Been fighting a headache all day so I'm moving my stream to Saturday instead! Here's the obligatory pet picture as an apology. Told y'all Bella sits like a derp! My internet connectivity seems to have come home from the war so I'm going to try streaming Walking Dead Saints & Sinners again tonight at 8:30! Or if it's like last night we'll just make live action stop motion videos.
